# calculator-beginner

This is a simple calculator i created to add to my portfolio projects.  
I really didn't want anything complex, just a simple HTML and CSS with a little javascript for the functionality.
For javaScript i used vue widgets to manipulate the dom,
and a math.js library via CDN for evaluation of expressions 

hopefully it will have many add ons as time goes by
